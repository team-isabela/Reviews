# Reviews - Back End
## About the project
Developed and scaled an existing e-commerce back-end to handle web scale traffic. The emphasis of this project was on deployment and optimization for perfomance at scale.
- Utilized PostgreSQL native functions to restructure responses at the multi-threaded database level to increase response times for complex queries
- Deployed a cluster of five Node.js/Express servers and an NGINX proxy server/load balancer to double maximum client requests per second 
- Developed and horizontally scaled back-end from 100 clients/second under load to over 10,0000 clients/second with potential to handle even greater stress with vertical scaling
